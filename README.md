==========================

I want to document what it takes to be a Solar Gardener in Pennsylvania.  A solar gardener is similar to a traditional gardener who grows plants, however a solar gardener setups up solar farms.  More information at solargardens.org.



#This is not a computer code project.  I am trying to crack the code for small scale solar development in Pennsylvania, United States.

There are many hurdles but I believe they are all manageable.  My goal is to document the process I use to develop a small solar farm, in hopes to make it easier for many in the future.  This is aimed at mostly community solar farms, but the same information could be used for for-profit solar farms.  I will be using solargardens.org as a resource.  I am not an expert in this field.


###Basic Outline

1. Start small (1,000 Watt or Less, ~2-4 Solar Panels).  
2. Discover the process.  
3.  Scale up.

###Detailed Outline


#####1. Legal, Business Plan, Regulatory, Insurance, Interconnect

- Develop business plan with Small Business Development center.
- Non Profit legal work is expensive.  This is a one-time fee and others in Pennsylvania could use the same nonprofit.
- During discovery, use separate accounts for money.  
- Find general Interconnect fees for smaller .5-10 KW, 10-50 KW, and larger systems.
- Cover solar panels and non-profit with insurance.

#####2. Land

- For discovery, use a home.
- For scale up - Could be leased warehouse roof space, leasable "brown field" land, eventually unused municipal land.  
- Farms could have crops or animals under high and well-spaced ground mount solar fields.
- Find general going price for land and roof lease.
- If possible offer royalty.

#####3. Financials

- My personal goal is 10 year ROI including leased land and all other costs.
- Investigate selling power to broker or local power users rather than the power company.
- Present business plan to local banks for financing.

#####4. Solar System

- Find local installer that uses latest solar technology.
- Use largest available USA sourced solar panels and matching micro inverters.
- Ground Mount:
	- Find quality affordable off the shelf solar rack system for ground mounting.  
	- Alternative use open projects design for custom fabricated solar rack system.  Insure this meets electric code.
- For roof mount, use off the shelf solar rack equipment.
